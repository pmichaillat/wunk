# Resolving New Keynesian Anomalies With Wealth in the Utility Function: Phase Diagrams

This repository contains the phase diagrams in the article ["Resolving New Keynesian Anomalies With Wealth in the Utility Function"](https://pascalmichaillat.org/11/), written by [Pascal Michaillat](https://pascalmichaillat.org) and [Emmanuel Saez](https://eml.berkeley.edu/~saez/), and published in the [Review of Economics and Statistics](https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00893) in May 2021.

## Situations described by the diagrams

The phase diagrams describe a range of situations.

+ Normal times – The natural rate of interest is positive, and monetary policy is active.
+ Zero lower bound (ZLB) – The natural rate of interest is negative, and the monetary-policy rate is zero.
+ ZLB episode of finite duration – The economy is at the ZLB between time 0 and time $T$, and it returns to normal after time $T$.
+ ZLB episode with forward guidance – The economy is at the ZLB between time 0 and time $T$. The economy is then in forward guidance between time $T$ and time $T + \Delta$: the natural rate of interest is positive but the monetary-policy rate is zero. Finally, the economy returns to normal after time $T + \Delta$. 
+ ZLB episode with government spending – The economy is at the ZLB between time 0 and time $T$. During the ZLB, government spending is positive. The economy returns to normal after time $T$.

+ `nk_shortzlb.key`, `nk_shortzlb.pdf` – NK model with short ZLB episode (figure 2A)
+ `nk_longzlb.key`, `nk_longzlb.pdf` – NK model with long ZLB episode (figure 2C)
+ `nk_fg.key`, `nk_fg.pdf` – NK model in forward guidance (figure 3A)
+ `nk_shortfg.key`, `nk_shortfg.pdf` – NK model when ZLB is followed by short forward guidance (figure 3B)

+ `nk_longfg.key`, `nk_longfg.pdf` – NK model when ZLB is followed by long forward guidance (figure 3D)
+ `nk_nog.key`, `nk_nog.pdf` – NK model at ZLB with no government spending (figure 5A)
