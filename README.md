# Resolving New Keynesian Anomalies With Wealth in the Utility Function: Phase Diagrams

This repository contains the phase diagrams from the paper "Resolving New Keynesian Anomalies With Wealth in the Utility Function", written by [Pascal Michaillat](https://pascalmichaillat.org) and [Emmanuel Saez](https://eml.berkeley.edu/~saez/), and published in the [Review of Economics and Statistics](https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00893) in May 2021.

## Paper webpage

The paper is available at https://pascalmichaillat.org/11/. The phase diagrams appear in figures 1–6.

## Situations described by the diagrams

The phase diagrams describe a range of situations.

+ Normal times – The natural rate of interest is positive, and monetary policy is active.
+ Zero lower bound (ZLB) – The natural rate of interest is negative, and the monetary-policy rate is zero.
+ ZLB episode of finite duration – The economy is at the ZLB between time 0 and time $T$, and it returns to normal after time $T$.
+ ZLB episode with forward guidance – The economy is at the ZLB between time 0 and time $T$. The economy is then in forward guidance between time $T$ and time $T + \Delta$: the natural rate of interest is positive but the monetary-policy rate is zero. Finally, the economy returns to normal after time $T + \Delta$. 
+ ZLB episode with government spending – The economy is at the ZLB between time 0 and time $T$. During the ZLB, government spending is positive. The economy returns to normal after time $T$.

## Phase diagrams for the NK model

The phase diagrams for the New Keynesian model (NK) are stored in the folder `nk`. The diagrams are drawn by hand using Keynote on Mac, and then exported to PDF.

+ `figure1C.key`, `figure1C.pdf` – Figure 1C: NK model at the ZLB
+ `figure2A.key`, `figure2A.pdf` – Figure 2A: NK model with short ZLB episode
+ `figure2C.key`, `figure2C.pdf` – Figure 2C: NK model with long ZLB episode
+ `figure3A.key`, `figure3A.pdf` – Figure 3A: NK model in forward guidance
+ `figure3B.key`, `figure3B.pdf` – Figure 3B: NK model with short forward guidance after  ZLB
+ `figure3C.key`, `figure3C.pdf` – Figure 3C: NK model with medium forward guidance after ZLB

## Phase diagrams for the WUNK model

The phase diagrams for the New Keynesian model with wealth in the utility function (WUNK) are stored in the `wunk` folder. The diagrams are drawn by hand using Keynote on Mac, and then exported to PDF.

+ `figure1D.key`, `figure1D.pdf` – Figure 1D: WUNK model at the ZLB 
+ `figure2B.key`, `figure2B.pdf` – Figure 2B: WUNK model with short ZLB episode 
+ `figure2D.key`, `figure2D.pdf` – Figure 2D: WUNK model with long ZLB episode 
+ `figure4A.key`, `figure4A.pdf` – Figure 4A: WUNK model in forward guidance 
+ `figure4B.key`, `figure4B.pdf` – Figure 4B: WUNK model with a short ZLB episode before forward guidance
